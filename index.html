        <p>for this project i decided to experiment with html and css to understand their basic ideas. These two are the most challenging aspect of the creative coding class that I took. 
            On this page, I have created two options for you in which you have fun with my project. You can select the drawing machine to make some sketches or you can also play the snake game. Both options have the ability to save the screen so be sure to save some shots when you are having fun.
            I also decided to use simple shapes to define the interface of my project.</p>
